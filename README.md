Developed a solver for the n-queens problem, wherein n queens are to be placed on an n×n chessboard so that no pair of queens can attack each other.

## Lights Outs Puzzle

The Lights Out puzzle consists of an m×n grid of lights, each of which has two states: on and off. The goal of the puzzle is to turn all the lights off, with the caveat that whenever a light is toggled, its neighbors above, below, to the left, and to the right will be toggled as well. If a light along the edge of the board is toggled, then fewer than four other lights will be affected, as the missing neighbors will be ignored.

Investigated the behavior of Lights Out puzzles of various sizes by implementing a LightsOutPuzzle class that can be tested with GUI provided by professor.
